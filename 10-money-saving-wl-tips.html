                                        It's a multitasker's dream scenario. But can saving cash really help shrink
                                        your waistline? Yes, according to behavioral psychologist Matt Wallaert.
                                        "Eating and
                                        spending are very similar behavioral processes in that they both are about the
                                        competition between our desires and the consequences," he says. "Psychologists
                                        often look at the lessons learned in one domain to apply them to others."

                                        <br><br>
                                        "One of the key findings with both spending and eating is that when people
                                        "break" their diet or budget, they tend to go big, figuring that they'll just
                                        start
                                        over tomorrow because it is broken for today," Wallaert says. Case in point:
                                        One
                                        study found that dieters who ate a single Hershey's Kiss in the morning overate
                                        for the
                                        rest of the day, saying they had already "failed" on their diet. Don't throw
                                        away good
                                        money after bad, Wallaert warns. "If you overspend, or overeat, each additional
                                        dollar
                                        or calorie is just making things worse."

                                        You can't buy what you don't shop for, so why tempt your willpower by spending
                                        time at
                                        the mall? While you may not be able to avoid all restaurants or stores, you can
                                        make
                                        little adjustments to your daily routine to help cut back on excess calories
                                        and
                                        spending. One study found that just moving a bowl of candy from your desk to a
                                        shelf
                                        across the room can dramatically decrease your daily intake. "Controlling your
                                        environment is critical in controlling your behavior, and we often forget just
                                        how
                                        important small changes can be," Wallaert says.

                                        While tracking your spending is a good idea, if you really want to get serious
                                        about saving both money and calories, create a budget. And when it comes to
                                        staying on task, cash is king.

                                        "Take a stack of envelopes and mark them for items you need/want to

                                        amount of cash in each envelope and once it's gone, it's gone. This will make

                                        One of the best ways to stay on track with your weight loss and savings goals?
                                        Regularly reward yourself for your efforts. "Choose a credit card that offers
                                        healthy
                                        ways to redeem points," Heckathorn suggests. "Have you always dreamed of
                                        enjoying an
                                        "exercise vacation" at a health spa where you do yoga twice a day? Choose the
                                        credit
                                        card, manage it responsibly, and you could make it happen for free."
                                        <br><br>
                                        Take action: Look for a credit card that offers you rewards you'll actually
                                        want to
                                        use, like the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. New cardholders can currently earn
                                        a
                                        sign-up bonus of 40,000 points after spending $3,000 during the first three
                                        months.
                                        That translates to $500 in free travel (a Bikini boot camp, perhaps?).
